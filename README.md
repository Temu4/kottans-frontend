## Git intro

[udacity.com - How to use Git and GitHub](./0_git_intro/udacity_git_intro.png)

Git and GitHub are perfect features, I'll use it.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

[codecademy.com: Learn the Commant Line](./1_task_linux_cli/Completed.png)

Very interesting course about Bash Commandline,
but too heavy informations about HTTP Protocols.

## Git Collaboration

[udacity.com - Version Control with Git](./2_git_collaboration/what_is_version_control.png)

[udacity.com - GitHub and Collaboration](./2_git_collaboration/github_collaboration.png)

Mostly repiting of the Git intro at stage 0 with couple remarks.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

[udacity.com - Intro to HTML and CSS](./3_task_html_css_intro/html_css_intro.png)

Some basic info.

[htmlacademy.ru - HTML and CSS basics](./3_task_html_css_intro/htmlacademy.ru.png)

Very good free materials and lubs.

## Responsive Web Design

[udacity.com - Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](./4_task_responsive_web_design/responsive_web_design_fundamentals.png)

I've met a large number of sites on the network without any optimization for mobile devices, which makes it impossible to use them.
I hope the acquired knowledge will help to make the interface convenient for people.

[flexboxfroggy.com - CSS Game](./4_task_responsive_web_design/flexbox_froggy.png)

Funny game! :frog:

[My project](https://github.com/Temu4/Booble-styled-page)

## JS Basics

[udacity.com - Intro to JavaScript](./6_task_js_basics/intro_to_javascript.png)

[learn.freecodecamp.org - Basic JavaScript](./6_task_js_basics/freecodecamp_basic_js.png)

So many useful things about arrays and objects.

[learn.freecodecamp.org - ES6](./6_task_js_basics/freecodecamp_es6.png)

Array's functions, spread array method, class.

[learn.freecodecamp.org - Basic Data Structure](./6_task_js_basics/freecodecamp_basic_data_srtuctures.png)

Topics about how to handle with objects ans arrays.

[learn.freecodecamp.org - Basic Algorithm Scripting](./6_task_js_basics/freecodecamp_basic_algorithm_scriting.png)

Tasks how to use your knowledge.
The execution of these tasks took me quite a long time, but it was worth it. Now I approach the solution of problems more pragmatically. Also I saved a lot of gists for my use.

[learn.freecodecamp.org - Functional Programming](./6_task_js_basics/freecodecamp_functional_programming.png]

Good introductory material about principles of the functional programming. Also good practical taskts, durring which I worked with arrays methods. Also, I'm really happy that understand array.reduce() method! :notebook:
