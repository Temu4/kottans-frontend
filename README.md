## Git intro

[udacity.com - How to use Git and GitHub](./0_git_intro/udacity_git_intro.png)

Git and GitHub are perfect features, I'll use it.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

[codecademy.com: Learn the Commant Line](./1_task_linux_cli/Completed.png)

Very interesting course about Bash Commandline,
but too heavy informations about HTTP Protocols.

## Git Collaboration

[udacity.com - Version Control with Git](./2_git_collaboration/what_is_version_control.png)

[udacity.com - GitHub and Collaboration](./2_git_collaboration/github_collaboration.png)

Mostly repiting of the Git intro at stage 0 with couple remarks.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

[udacity.com - Intro to HTML and CSS](./3_task_html_css_intro/html_css_intro.png)

Some basic info.

[htmlacademy.ru - HTML and CSS basics](./3_task_html_css_intro/htmlacademy.ru.png)

Very good free materials and lubs.

## Responsive Web Design

[udacity.com - Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](./4_task_responsive_web_design/responsive_web_design_fundamentals.png)

I met a large number of sites on the network without any optimization for mobile devices, which makes it impossible to use them.
I hope the acquired knowledge will help to make the interface convenient for people.
